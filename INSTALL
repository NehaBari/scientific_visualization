1. Build the FFTW library:

cd fftw-2.1.5/sourceAndDoc

./configure

If something does not work in the above step, please see the FFTW documentation.

make

cp fftw/.libs/libfftw.a ../lib
cp rfftw/.libs/librfftw.a ../lib

cd ../..


2. Building the application itself


Download and install Qt (http://www.qt.io/). Then

qmake

make

The final application, called smoke, should be created in the current directory (where this INSTALL file is placed).
