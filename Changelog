v1 -> Skeleton code compiled
v2 -> Extracted simulation code to simulation.c to keep simulation and visualization separate
v3 -> Extracted visualization code into file named visualization.c 
v4 -> Made a Simulation class for clarity of code
v5 -> Changed C compiler to CPP to use QT for UI
v6 -> Use Qt to make the GUI
v7 -> Added multibox for scalar coloring
v8 -> fixed size color bar
