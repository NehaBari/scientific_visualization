Fluid Flow demo for Mac OS X
=============================

1. Description

This is the fluid flow demo application ported for Mac OS X. For a full description of the aims and scope of this application, please see the general platform-independent documentation.



2. Building

2.0. Requirements

This application has been tested on several MacBook (Pro) computers running OS X versions 10.11.x and 10.10.5. The code does only depend on the OpenGL and GLUT frameworks, which are both installed by default under OS X.


2.1. Building the FFTW library:

cd fftw-2.1.5/sourceAndDoc

./configure

If something does not work in the above step, please see the FFTW documentation.

make

cp fftw/.libs/libfftw.a ../lib
cp rfftw/.libs/librfftw.a ../lib

cd ../..


2.2. Building the application itself


Download and install Qt (http://www.qt.io/). Then

qmake

make

The final application, called smoke, should be created in the current directory (where this README file is placed).
